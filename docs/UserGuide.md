## Saving and Editing Data
- Data is saved automatically after each change.
- Stored locally at: `[JAR folder]/data/addressbook.json`

> ⚠️ **Caution**: Manual edits to the JSON file may corrupt data. Always back up first.

---

## FAQ

**Q:** _How do I transfer my HRQuickAccess data to another computer?_  
**A:** Install the app on the new computer and replace its `addressbook.json` file with your backup.

---

## Known Issues

1. **GUI opens off-screen** after disconnecting a secondary monitor.  
   _Fix_: Delete `preferences.json`.
2. **Help Window doesn't reappear** if previously minimized.  
   _Fix_: Manually restore the minimized window.

---

## Considerations

1. Company and rank allows for alphabetical and alphanumeric characters respectively instead of using enumeration for flexibility, as different services and battalions have different naming styles.
2. Masked NRICs are not unique, so unique personnel are determined by 2 features: Name and Masked NRIC. If they are unique to another personnel, they will be determined as separate entities.
3. Mass assigning duty dates to multiple personnel results in the last index to be highlighted (e.g. if you "assign 3 1 2 d/2025-05-06", the personnel with index 2 is highlighted).
4. To add a personnel profile photo, the photo will have to be renamed as `[NAME]_[NRIC].png/jpeg/jpg` (e.g. Corey Siah_Txxxx123A.png), and placed in `./data/images/`.
5. Do not attempt to manually amend `addressbook.json` as it may result in data corruption.
6. `name` automatically trims leading and trailing spaces.
7. Personnel duty dates reflect the number of duty dates they are assigned in the current month.
